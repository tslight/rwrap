.SH NAME

rwrap \- backup or restore all user profiles on a host

.SH SYNOPSIS

rwrap [-br] [uxv] [-hH] [SHARE] [MOUNTPOINT]

.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS

.IP -b
Backup user profiles from /Users to /mountpoint/Users/user/date.
.IP -r
Restore user profiles from /mountpoint/Users/user/date to /Users.

.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS

.IP -u
Process all users without prompting.
.IP -x
Automatically choose sane excludes (Caches, Trash, etc).
.IP -v
Verbose stream. Useful for debugging.
.IP -h
Display this help and exit.

.SH ARGUMENTS

Takes a share url as an argument, in either standard mount_smbfs form:
//username:password@host/path/to/PARENT/of/Users, or standard mount_nfs form:
host:path/to/PARENT/of/Users, or standard rsync URL form:
//rsync:host:port/path/to/PARENT/of/Users

Takes a mountpoint as an argument: /Volumes/Backups. If a share has been entered
it will be mounted here, otherwise we backup to this location. If no share or
mountpoint is entered you will be prompted to enter them. If your share is a
valid rsync url, there is no need to enter a mountpoint.

.SH PITFALLS & CAVEATS

THE PATH ON THE REMOTE HOST MUST POINT TO PARENT OF Users, NOT Users!

Once mounted the mountpoint should contain the Users directory underneath it.
The script backups to or restores from the following directory layout underneath
the mountpoint: Users/user.name/date, and logs to:
Logs/CopyType/user.name/date.log, where CopyType equals either Backup or
Restore. If this layout does not exist it will be created under the mountpoint.

Unless backing up to a samba share, user, group and permissions will be retained
and each backup will be hard-linked against the last to save space and mimic the
functionality of Time Machine.

When using Samba, in combination with Active Directory, ownership & permissions
attributes are mangled, so these are not preserved in this use case, making
incremental backups with hard links impossible. This is also the reason itâ€™s
necessary to recursively chown the users directory when restoring from a Samba
share. If possible use this script in conjunction with either an NFS or rsync
server, or a USB drive.

It's also worth pointing out that for the time being preserving extended
attributes is not supported.

.SH EXAMPLES

To backup from /Users to a Samba share mounted at /Volumes/Backups/Users:

backup -b //user:password@hostname/Backups/macOS /Volumes/Backups

To restore from a Samba share mounted at /Volumes/Backups/Users to /Users,
choosing sane defaults:

backup -rx //user:password@hostname/Backups/macOS /Volumes/Backups

To backup from /Users to a rsync server, without prompting for each user:

backup -bu rsync://user@host:port/backups

To restore from /Users to a rsync server, with increased verbosity:

restore -rv rsync://user@host:port/backups
